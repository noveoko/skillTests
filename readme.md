## Alphabet Soup

A simple skills test to ensure you are able to write high-quality maintainable code that runs fast

### Break-down

This function takes two strings as input:

* your message
* a random assortment of letters made up of from 1 to 24 letters of the English alphabet
Assumptions:

### Keep in mind

* The number of letters may be of any size
* You cannot know for certain how often each letter will occur throughout the assortment (some letters may be absent)
* The letters are ordered randomly

### Return values

* If your message may be recreated from the assorted letters return True
* If your message cannot be recreated from the assorted letters return False

### Quality first

* The function should run as quickly and efficiently as possible
* Use Big-O notation to communicate how well your function performs
* Use any langauge (in this case Python)
